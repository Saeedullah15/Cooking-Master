    <p>after spending around 8 hours, i figured out nothing. its so confusing. i dont understand how to start, where to start. i saw api related videos over and over again, what is done in the video i can do that. i know what to do in the assignment but i dont understand how to code for the assignment. i seek for help in google, youtube. the more i see, the more i get confused. can you please tell me why this is happening? what should i do to recover this as soon as possible? <span style="color: red;">please make me know in assignment's feedback.</span></p>
    <P>i know i wont get any marks but i dont want to submit late or make this due. also new module will release, thats why submitting. and i dont want to post in the group, thats why writing here.</P>
